# TypeScript Tomfoolery

## Hi! This is where I aim to organise the notes I make as I learn TypeScript.

<br>

I'm not sure how this repository will grow - maybe it will be just notes - another git ~~respository~~ ~~repositry~~ repository that you can star for reference. Or maybe I'll try and get another project out of this - who knows.

For now, this is my corner to be accountable and document my progress. Contributions/corrections/feedback welcome (assuming anybody apart from me reads this README). The first order of business would be to figure out a `CONTRIBUTING.md`?
